# CONTACT STYLE STARTER
---

### Key Objectives: 
* To start to stylize the contact section.

### Overview:
Now that we have the Contact form working with formspree.io, we should start to stylize the form. We stylize after because it can be difficult to see where we put our formspree items amidst any styling and css ids & class names. Get the data passing, then style up our UI.

### Notes/Tips
* This is another open ended task, and it gets hard to identify when you are done. We recommend time boxing your work.
* We know it's just a contact form, but showing your skills here is just as important as anything else on your site, especially since this might be a tool that a potential client or employer might use.

### Steps
1. There is no video for this module. Essentially, we are adding style to our contact form.
2. Open your teminal window and do `git pull`. This will make sure that you have the most up to date version of our code. If you started this project early on, we might have made updates to this module.
3. Style your contact form in accordance with the theme that you're seeing in the rest of your app.
4. Commit the code.
5. Go on to the next module.
