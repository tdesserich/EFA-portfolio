# NAVBAR STYLE STARTER
---

### Key Objectives
* To start using our build tools to work with HTML and CSS changes.
* To gain a deeper understanding of CSS and Bootstrap through using the tools.
* To begin creating a customized look, feel, and functionality for our navbar.
* Practice using Gulp for faster site construction.

### Overview
In this module we start to refactor what we've already stubbed out. This is the time that we'll make custom changes to our application in our Navbar. Using our Sass + Gulp tasks, we can now more quickly make adjustments to our site.

### Notes/Tips
* If this doesn't work for you at first, try copying and pasting our current gulpfile.js into yours. If you do this, be sure to still read and understand the Gulpfile to the best of your ability. (Is this just a copy paste?)
