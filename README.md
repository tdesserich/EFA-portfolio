## Current Branch Activity
1. Hover effect added to each portfolio items.
2. Portfolio items are sized properly, except the 
3. Added section title info to the body for global usage. 
4. Set up minification for JavaScript with gulp. 
5. Reference the minified JS file now that gulp is minifying the JS everytime we save. 

## Current Gulp Tasks
- `gulp serve` uses browserSync & opens a project in the browser. Reloads when you save.
- `gulp sass` compiles scss files as css.
- `gulp minify-js` takes out all whitespace in JavaScript and pipes it into the .min.js file.
- `gulp dev` runs both the serve and sass commands. Watches for changes in any of those files.
