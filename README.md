# Eleven Fifty Starter Portfolio
This is a starter repo to help students get started on building a Bootstrap template. 

## Branches

 * [master](https://github.com/ElevenfiftyAcademy/JavaScript-151-PortfolioStarter) - The most up to date version of the code.

## Current Gulp Tasks

- `gulp serve` uses browserSync & opens a project in the browser. Reloads when you save.
