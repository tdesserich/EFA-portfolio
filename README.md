## Current Branch Activity
1. The sole focus of this branch is to get started on shaping the header section.
2. The _header.scss file includes some changes to the jumbotron. 
3. A body scss file was added to start managing global css and setting some slight padding around the body. We also centered the header section there. 

## Current Gulp Tasks
- `gulp serve` uses browserSync & opens a project in the browser. Reloads when you save.
- `gulp sass` compiles scss files as css.
- `gulp dev` runs both the serve and sass commands. Watches for changes in any of those files.

## Reading
Extra reading for getting started with CSS centering.
 * [Centering - CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/) - Good read on centering elements.
 * [Bootstrap Example](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/album/) - The Jumbotron starter was influenced by Bootstrap 4's album example. Be aware that we're using Bootstrap 3.
